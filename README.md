Class: Comp 440 Database Design

Date: 10/20/22 

Phase 1: Utlizes PHP and SQL to accomplish the following- 

1.) A database schema which implements a user registration and login interface so that only registered users can login into the system. 
The schema of the user table is: 
user(username, password, firstName, lastName, email)
Primary key is username, emails are unique.  
Prevents the SQL injection attack. 

2.) Allows users to sign up with information such as: username, password, password confirmed, first name, last  name, email. Duplicate usernames and emails are detected and fail the signup. 
Additionally, unmatching passwords are detected.

3.) Implements a button called “Initialize Database.” Which allows users to create/recreate necessary tables automatically.
